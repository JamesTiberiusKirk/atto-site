        - [ ] Twitter
        - [ ] Instagram
    - [ ] Atto supports...
- [ ] Menu hamburger
    - [ ] application page
    - [ ] contact me page
    - [ ] ...?
- [ ] Application form page
    - [ ] All the correct fields
    - [ ] Including the correct workshops
    - [ ] Input validation
    - [ ] Thanks for your application screen
- [ ] Contact me form page
    - [ ] Pretty much same functionality as application form but less fields

# IDEAS
- For admin login, worth just using admin email env variable (as array)
    - then send a one time code to the email at login
    - OR use OAuth with some provider and only let in if its the correct email
    - option 1 is simpler

# Notes:

# Feedback round 1 
## Opening page
- [x]Lets try it with the atto logo being bigger 
- [x]the downside logo needs to be central below the text “atto supports” 
- [x]“atto supports and the downside logo can be smaller
- [x]is there a way you can have the “apply” button transform when hovered over in some way. Movement and colour would be the best.
- [x]Can the “apply” button be slightly bigger
    - **NOTES:** Have made it bigger and could make it even bigger, but it was looking a bit odd to me when testing.
- [x]Can the picture at the top be unblured 
    - **QUESTION:** Are you happy with the quality of the picture?

## What we do
- [x]"Professional actors with professional directors” can this be in a different colour and bigger, this is the header of the text.
    - **NOTES:** made the font bigger but also made sure not to make it bigger than the actual page title itself
- [x]can you centre the text swell so there not a gap at the bottom of the box
- [x]can we swap in the photo for this one <!-- TODO: Find the photo which is on the email -->
- [ ]Also this is where I would like to put the video in the future. So on top of this image need a play button that links to youtube video but this can be done later not urgent. 
    - **NOTE:** Not sure how well this would work as this picture is a portrait and the vid I'm assuming would be landscape
- [x]can you put an apply button at the bottom of the text as well 

## Other participants 
- [x]Can you put the text to the left of the box and have a slideshow of the other pics I sent on the right handside of the box. 
- [x]can you put an apply button at the bottom of this as well

## Footer
- [x]Can we have twitter and insta link in the footer and the email address: info@attoworkshops.com
- [x]https://twitter.com/attoworkshops
- [x]https://instagram.com/attoworkshops
- [ ]https://vimeo.com/820843498
    - **NOTES:** video is under age restriction or something
